                        We are Mark and Olga Lubarsky, husband and wife. We’ve been practicing movement methods here in San Mateo area since 2001. Originally, we founded Pilates Family® studio where we focused on physical rehabilitation and prevention from injuries. In 2007, we discovered Anat Baniel and Feldenkrais methods. This experience had opened our eyes to new possibilities to help our clients. We studied with Anat Baniel for several years and expanded our practice to include this powerful transformational work. We observed significant changes in our clients’ well-being, from natural pain relief and recovery to achieving maximum potential through ease and freedom of movement.

                        Olga was raised in a family of a well-respected Orthopedic Doctor. She observed her grandmother saving injured patients on a daily basis. Olga grew passionate about helping those in pain, which brought her to this profession. After years of Pilates instruction, Olga was inspired by the power of ABM/Feldenkrais method and found ways to integrate two modalities. Olga is a certified Pilates instructor since 2002. She also completed a 756 hours of Feldenkrais-based training with Anat Baniel 2009-2012, including Children’s Mastery certification.  Olga is offering Functional Synthesis(™) lessons (hands-on work), Transformational Movement Lessons(™) and Pilates.
