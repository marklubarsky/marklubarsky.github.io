                        Both Pilates and Feldenkrais methods are great ways to improve fitness and body awareness. Pilates is focused on muscle toning and balance, whereas Feldenkrais is focused on relearning new, healthier ways of movement. Pilates exercises involve sophisticated machinery or mat props. Feldenkrais comes in two shapes: hands-on bodywork, as well as exercises on the floor. Please note that we practice an extension of Feldenkrais method, which is now known as ABM NeuroMovement.

                                Feldenkrais® Method is a form of a movement re-education that helps with chronic pain and limitations on the neuromuscular level. Dr. Feldenkrais believed that increasing a person’s self-awareness of functional movement could lead to increased function, reduced pain, and greater ease and pleasure of movement. Anat Baniel Method evolved from the Feldenkrais method based on the modern understanding of brain plasticity and relationship between neurology and movement. Anat Baniel (our teacher and the founder of this method) was a student and close collaborator of Dr. Moshe Feldenkrais. Originally started as a style of Feldenkrais method, Anat Baniel's method is now well-known as NeuroMovement®.
